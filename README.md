# Seminar Project - Project Portfolio Planning Under CO2 Fleet Emission Restrictions in the Automotive Industry
This repository built is for the project in the advance seminar in operations management.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to reproduce Thies et al.(2022)'s work and conduct addional computational study to gain some managerial insights. Thies et al.(2022) use Project Portfolio Planning (PPP), a strategic approach to choose between projects sharing limited resources to achieve certain business objectives, for deciding which car models should be produced in order to optimize the Net Present Value(NPV).

## Approach: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
The main model to solve the PPP problem is based on MILP. The solver used is Gurobi.

## Content
1. Data - provided by Thies et al.(2022)
2. AS_in_Operation_Management.ipynb - the main notebook for data processing, model creation, model optimization, computational study
3. Report.pdf - the detailed report for this project
